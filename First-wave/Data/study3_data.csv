Some politicians are using this pandemic for political power, but others are not.  I do trust some scientists/doctors, but I don't blindly trust them either.  Part of science is analyzing data for bias, and also being skeptical about early findings.  This is a new virus, so no one knows a lot about the risks or outcomes yet.  I believe in the benefit of vaccines, but I am skeptical about rushing out to get one that hasn't been properly tested yet.  I'll have to wait and see the data before I blindly say I want a vaccine.  I also think that anyone telling you the virus is naturally occurring is either lying or uninformed.  China has not allowed any outside parties into Wuhan to investigate this pandemic, so there is no way of knowing for certain why this pandemic occurred.

I take social distancing seriously, and only go out for essential tasks.  I also wear a face mask all day at work, and anytime I go to a store.  However, I do think this pandemic is being exaggerated, based on the new data coming out about antibody testing.  The sad and scary thing about this virus is that there is a certain (small) percentage of people where the infection will be severe or deadly.  But for most people, they won't even know they are sick, or it will seem like a normal respiratory illness.  ",,2,33,1,3,SC,4,14,6,6,1,4.411,4.411,6.045,1

1) Coronavirus is a major threat to public health, but when you pit it against suicide, obesity, traffic fatalities (...etc.), calling it the biggest in recent times is a bit of a stretch.
2) Vaccines are, for any individual virus strain, the single most effective population-level defense against the virus.
3) Politicians probably will use the coronavirus as justification for mandating a vaccine, but to call that an ""excuse"" seems rather weird. The virus IS good justification fro mandating a vaccine.
4) Though I tend to say ""coronavirus"" or ""COVID"", the virus did likely emerge from Wuhan China, so to call it the ""Wuhan virus"" or the ""Chinese virus"" wouldn't be unreasonable.
5) I generally find doctors and scientists trustworthy, and to the extent that poor information (sourced from a scientist or doctor) gets disseminated to the public, it's usually poor because of poor journalism or political misinformation, and not the fault of the scientist or doctor. But, there are exceptions. There exists a Dr. Oz, after all.
6) While I do believe a functional, top-down shutdown of the economy has done more overall harm than competing approaches, the idea that we should stop social distancing to kickstart the economy is silly. Even with a fully-opened economy, social distancing will remain prudent for some time, and will, alone, have minimal economic impact.

Thus, the early reports of exceedingly high death rate percentages were gross overestimates based on faulty modelling.  It now appears the death rate for this virus is more close to that of a bad flu season. Countries with a different approach to battling COVID-19, such as Sweden, where total shutdown was not ordered, seemed to fair relatively well.  They behaved in ways that have been shown historically to be effective at reducing infection without imposing unprecedented (and scientifically untested) social approaches to limit spread of a virus. This is not to say that SARS-CoV2 does not present any risk. To the contrary. People will die from COVID-19, but people will also die from the flu, from poor lifestyle choices, and from iatrogenic causes. Given a newer, more enlightened understanding of the virus, the mitigation strategies need to be re-assessed. While some media personalities and politicians bounce from one side of the debate to the other based on their political objectives, the sad reality is that ulterior motive often drives public debate. As a PhD biochemist and biomedical researcher, I evaluate the science.  Real science (that should educate decision-makers) should not be based on a single study, on political organizations declaring the ""correct"" way to think, or on today's spin on the next fear-based speculation.  And science is not a hammer to be used to club those that disagree.  Legitimate scientific debate should be open and uncensored. ",no,1,56,1,1,texas,4,20,5,5,1,8.395,8.483,14.447,2
